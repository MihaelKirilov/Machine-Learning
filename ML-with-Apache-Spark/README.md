Spark is a distributed computing system that handles large-scale data sets efficiently.

Data engineers benefit from various features provided by Spark, which aid in creating scalable and effective data processing pipelines.

With Spark's distributed computing approach, in-memory processing capabilities, and APIs, data engineers can tackle complex data structures and work with massive datasets.

Classification using Spark ML is the task of predicting categorical labels or classes for a given set of features.

Classification algorithms can be applied in various domains, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, fraud detection, and image classification.

Regression, using Spark ML, involves building and training regression models using the machine learning libraries offered by Spark.

Regression algorithms enable the creation of models that predict continuous target variables using input features.

Clustering, powered by Spark ML, involves grouping similar data points into clusters based on shared characteristics or patterns.

Classification algorithms are well-suited for applications like customer segmentation, anomaly detection, image segmentation, and recommendation systems.

K-means algorithm instance specifies the number of clusters (k) and a random seed for reproducibility.

GraphFrames, integrated with Apache Spark, enables graph processing using DataFrames.

It provides separate DataFrames for graph vertices and edges, which can be analyzed with SparkSQL.

GraphFrames also includes popular built-in graph algorithms that can be applied to the edge and vertex DataFrames for various analysis tasks.
