Apache Spark Structured Streaming supports the processing of streaming data using Spark SQL.

Feature extraction and transformation are crucial components of data preprocessing.

Feature extraction involves selecting or deriving significant features from raw data for analysis or modeling purposes.

MLlib provides various feature extraction techniques such as Tokenization, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and PCA.

Feature transformation involves converting extracted features into a suitable format for subsequent analysis.

Spark offers commonly used feature transformation techniques like Scaling and normalization, One-hot encoding, StringIndexer, and PCA.

Machine learning pipelines automate and structure the end-to-end ML process.

They involve interconnected steps like data ingestion, cleaning, preprocessing, and so on.

Advantages of ML models include reproducibility, scalability, automation, flexibility, and many more.

Spark provides powerful tools for building and deploying ML models at scale.

Its key components simplify ML tasks, providing advantages such as scalability, performance, and ease of use.

Model persistence is an important concept in machine learning that involves saving a trained model to disk for future use.

Model persistence is an essential component of machine learning pipelines.

By enabling the saving and reuse of trained models, it enhances machine learning systems' efficiency, scalability, and flexibility.

Its advantages collectively contribute to improved productivity, reproducibility, and collaboration in the field of machine learning.
