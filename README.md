# Machine Learning Learning Journey

Hi there! Welcome to my machine learning learning journey repository!

## Introduction

I'm just starting out in the exciting field of machine learning, and I've decided to document my learning journey here. This repository serves as a record of what I've learned, the projects I've worked on, and the resources I've found helpful along the way.

## Goals

My primary goal is to gain a solid understanding of machine learning concepts and techniques, and ultimately apply them to solve real-world problems. Along the way, I aim to build a diverse portfolio of projects that demonstrate my skills and understanding.


## Current Focus

I'm currently focusing on building a strong foundation in machine learning fundamentals. This includes understanding algorithms, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and more.
